# Module 4: Enumeration

## üìå Overview
The **Enumeration module** of CEHv13 focuses on extracting information from systems, services, and applications to build a detailed picture of the target environment. Enumeration is the step after scanning and involves active connections to gather usernames, shares, network resources, and more.

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand the purpose and importance of enumeration.  
- Learn common enumeration techniques.  
- Extract information from services such as SNMP, SMB, LDAP, and DNS.  
- Apply countermeasures against enumeration attacks.
