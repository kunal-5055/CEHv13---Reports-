# 🕵️‍♂️ Footprinting & Reconnaissance  

Footprinting is the **first phase of ethical hacking**, where an attacker (or security tester) gathers as much information as possible about a target system, network, or organization.  
The goal is to create a complete profile of the target before attempting further exploitation.  

---

## 📌 Objectives of Footprinting  

- Gather publicly available information about the target.  
- Identify potential entry points into the system.  
- Understand the target’s security posture.  
- Build a blueprint for attack simulation.

## 🔑 Types of Footprinting  

### 1. **Passive Footprinting**  
Collecting information without directly interacting with the target.  
- WHOIS lookups  
- DNS enumeration  
- Google hacking (Google Dorks)  
- Social media & public records  

### 2. **Active Footprinting**  
Interacting with the target system to obtain information.  
- Ping sweeps  
- Traceroute analysis  
- Port scanning  
- Banner grabbing

## 🛠️ Common Tools Used  

- **WHOIS / Nslookup / Dig** → Domain & DNS information  
- **Maltego** → OSINT & relationship mapping  
- **theHarvester** → Email & subdomain gathering  
- **Recon-ng** → Automated reconnaissance framework  
- **Shodan** → Internet-connected devices search engine  
- **Google Dorks** → Advanced search queries for sensitive data  

---

## 📑 Example Information Collected  

- Domain names & IP addresses  
- Subdomains & DNS records  
- Email addresses & employee details  
- Network ranges & topology  
- Open ports & running services  
- Technology stack used (CMS, servers, frameworks)

## ⚠️ Ethical Note  

This module is for **educational and defensive security purposes only**.  
Information gathering should only be performed on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
