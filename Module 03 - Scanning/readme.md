# Module 3: Scanning

## üìå Overview
The **Scanning module** of CEHv13 focuses on identifying live systems, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities within a target network. It builds on information gathered during footprinting and reconnaissance to map the attack surface.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand network scanning techniques and methodologies.  
- Identify active hosts and discover services running on them.  
- Perform port, network, and vulnerability scanning.  
- Learn countermeasures to scanning activities.

   - Types of scanning (ping, port, service, vulnerability).  
   - Scanning methodologies.  

2. **Host Discovery**  
   - ICMP scanning.  
   - ARP scanning.  
   - TCP/UDP ping sweeps.  

3. **Port & Service Scanning**  
   - TCP connect and SYN scans.  
   - UDP scanning.  
   - Service version detection.  

4. **Scanning Tools & Techniques**

   - Hping3 for custom packet crafting.  
   - Automated vulnerability scanners.  

5. **Evasion Techniques**  
   - Firewalls and IDS/IPS evasion.  
   - Banner grabbing prevention.  

6. **Defensive Measures**  
   - Network monitoring.  
   - Firewall/IDS/IPS configurations.
