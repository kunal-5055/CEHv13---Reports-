# 🛡️ Vulnerability Analysis

## 📘 Overview
Vulnerability Analysis is the process of identifying, classifying, and prioritizing security weaknesses in systems, applications, or networks.  
It helps security professionals proactively discover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand different types of vulnerabilities.
- Learn tools and techniques for vulnerability discovery.
- Perform vulnerability scanning and assessment.
- Analyze and interpret scan results.
- Prioritize remediation based on risk levels.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Vulnerability** → A weakness in a system that can be exploited.
- **Exploit** → A method or tool used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Threat** → A potential event that can exploit a vulnerability.
- **Risk** → The probability and impact of a vulnerability being exploited.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Commonly Used
- **Nessus** – Industry standard vulnerability scanner.  
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability assessment tool.  
- **Nmap (with NSE scripts)** – For scanning and detecting vulnerabilities.  
- **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability scanner.  
- **Burp Suite** – Web application vulnerability assessment.  

---

## 📂 Methodology
1. **Information Gathering** → Collect data about target environment.  
2. **Scanning & Enumeration** → Identify open ports, services, and applications.  
3. **Vulnerability Detection** → Use automated and manual methods to discover weaknesses.  
4. **Analysis & Verification** → Validate and prioritize vulnerabilities.  
5. **Reporting & Remediation** → Document findings and provide mitigation strategies.

## ⚠️ Common Vulnerabilities
- **Unpatched Software**  
- **Weak or Default Credentials**  
- **Misconfigurations**  
- **SQL Injection & XSS**  
- **Insecure APIs**  
- **Privilege Escalation Flaws**  

---

## 📑 Deliverables
- Vulnerability Scan Reports  
- Risk Ratings (CVSS scoring recommended)  
- Suggested Mitigations & Patches  
- Executive Summary  

---

## 📌 Notes
- Always conduct vulnerability analysis with **proper authorization**.  
- Misuse of these techniques against unauthorized systems is **illegal**.  
- Regular vulnerability assessments help organizations stay secure against evolving threats.
