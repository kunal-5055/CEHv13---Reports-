# Malware Analysis

## Overview
Malware Analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, impact, and techniques. The main goal is to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats by analyzing how malware works, spreads, and compromises systems.

This module provides insights into different malware analysis techniques, tools, and methodologies used by security professionals.

## Types of Malware Analysis
1. **Static Analysis**
   - Examining malware without executing it.
   - Focuses on file properties, code structure, and metadata.
   - Tools: `PEiD`, `Strings`, `Dependency Walker`.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Running malware in a controlled environment (sandbox).
   - Observes real-time behavior such as API calls, registry changes, or network traffic.
   - Tools: `Cuckoo Sandbox`, `Process Monitor`, `Wireshark`.

3. **Hybrid Analysis**
   - Combines static and dynamic techniques for more detailed insights.

## Malware Analysis Process
1. **Preparation**
   - Set up isolated lab environment (VMs, sandboxes).
   - Ensure network monitoring tools are active.

2. **Static Examination**
   - Check file signatures, hashes, and metadata.
   - Extract embedded strings.
   - Identify packers or obfuscation.

3. **Dynamic Execution**
   - Run malware in a sandbox.
   - Capture process creation, file modifications, and registry changes.
   - Monitor network communications.

4. **Advanced Reverse Engineering**
   - Use disassemblers and debuggers to understand the inner workings.
   - Identify persistence mechanisms, payloads, and exploit techniques.

## Common Tools
- **Static Analysis:** `BinText`, `PE Explorer`, `Detect It Easy (DIE)`
- **Dynamic Analysis:** `Procmon`, `Regshot`, `Wireshark`
- **Reverse Engineering:** `IDA Pro`, `Ghidra`, `OllyDbg`, `x64dbg`
- **Sandboxes:** `Cuckoo Sandbox`, `Any.Run`, `Joe Sandbox`

---

## Best Practices
- Always use isolated environments (VMs or sandboxes).
- Take snapshots before running suspicious files.
- Keep malware samples secure and encrypted.
- Document findings thoroughly for reporting.

---

## Real-World Use Cases
- Identifying malware families and variants.
- Detecting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Supporting incident response and digital forensics.
- Enhancing threat intelligence.
